Work with Brandon if he can't figure out how to upload/fetch images.

Apollo - Fetch events from firebase under /events/ and display them on the 
map as the map stands now.

Ryan - event listing page.
rsvp to event that somebody else posted (FROM EVENT LISTING).
Would have to have event data up on 
firebase, posted by somebody else. /events/ Then would create a new branch 
/events/$eventID/rspv with listings of $uidOfRSPV 
Homescreen functionality? Link eventlisting to homescreen.
